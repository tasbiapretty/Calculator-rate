how to use it


Why did you make this? (TTA)
During this Pandemic i relaised there has been no pandemic inssurance cover as of yet!, health insurance dealing with the pandemic in specific. 

So i made a website that covers all of this
All the legal documents such as disclaimers, disclosure, contracts, statutory provisons, Trademark and others are still in the process of happening. 

This project i am just focusing on the software, building the website that will provide a quote

Home page will contain brief information about the insurance comapny 

Enter details page is about creating a risk score by completing the questionnair which will generate a risk score which i will then add the risk score pass data to the next page the (chose your cover) using JS and Jquery. But this will not show the risk present to the client. (This is something i am still working on)

Choose your cover page, will be a seclected fixed price plan which will be added pass the data to the overall summary on the same page and the next page using JS. (Sucessfuly was able to do)

Adjust your cover page, has same fucntion, this will add to the summary of what the client has choosen to cover thier personalised insurance as well the the total cost. Again pass the data to next page the Quote page using JS and Jquery. 


Quote page, this will contain data from previous pages the client has choosen and using JS, will generate a quote by using a riskCalc which will take in account the risk score, costs of covers choosen, againts time (12 months one year).

Client can choose to pay anuually or monthly will have 2 different card with 2 different button one for annuanlly and one for monthly. 

Contact us I will create a Form requiring User input.
